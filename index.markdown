<h1>Ahlan!</h1>

<p>My name is Karim, and I will change the world. My life goal is to make the world slightly better than when I was born into it.</p>

<p>My philosophy is if there is something I need that is not available, I will try to make it myself. I love opensource, and would rather opensource everything I make - which I have done so far, and hopefully continue doing so for a long time. </p>

<p>Currently love dabbling with Cybersecurity and Deep Learning whether Pytorch, Swift or Ruby. <br />
