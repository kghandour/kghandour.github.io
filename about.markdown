## I am Karim

People say if someone asks you to introduce yourself but you cannot talk about your work, age or nationality, how would you do it?

Personally? I am a creator. I love tinkering around and understand how things work. When I learn something, I have to use it to create something. Currently tinkering around Pytorch, Swift and Ruby. I am also creating my own personal knowledge base as I learn things.
